Once a recruit has completed a mission, it is no longer possible to delete an objective. This ensures data integrity and preserves records of past completions.

This situation generally occurs only during testing. In such cases, we recommend deleting the recruits from the mission. Otherwise, please archive and duplicate the mission.

## Solution A: Delete or reset recruits

To delete all recruits without exception, navigate to the "Recruits" page of the mission and select "Delete all recruits" from the page menu.

Alternatively, you may choose to delete or reset individual recruits by navigating to the "Recruits" page and selecting their name. Once on the recruit's page, the page menu will display two options: "Reset" or "Delete" the mission. The reset option functions like delete, except that it retains the user as a recruit.

## Solution B: Archive and duplicate

If deleting recruits from the mission is not a viable solution, please navigate to the "Advanced" page of the mission and archive it. This step ensures that both the original and new missions are not active simultaneously. Once the mission has been archived, create a duplicate (excluding recruitment automations). The objective will be deletable in the new version.

Please note that recruits will need to be re-recruited for the new mission, recruitment automations will have to be recreated, and any outcomes referencing the original mission will require updating.
