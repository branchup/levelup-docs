title: "Watch video"
---

Objective to require the recruit to watch one or more videos to completion.

## Setting up

Set the number of videos to be watched, and optionally restrict which activity the videos must be placed in.

### Restricted to activity

When the objective is restricted to a particular activity, Quest will only consider videos that are viewed by navigating directly to the activity. The following activity types and options are supported:

- Page: Where the video is embedded in the page content
- File: Where the video is uploaded as a file
- URL: Where the URL is a YouTube video, and the display mode is set to \"Embed\"

## Behaviour

The algorithm for detecting that a video was watched to completion balances rigidity and leniency to provide the best user experience while achieving the intended behaviour. As such, jumping to the end of the video will not be considered valid. Conversely, watching 100% from start to finish is not strictly required.

Watching the same video multiple times will not progress the objective multiple times.

## Eligible videos

The videos compatible with this objective must be played by the built-in video player called "VideoJS". Thishich is the default behaviour in Moodle. Videos that are played using another mechanism or player are currently not supported.

Administrators can navigate to "Site administration > Plugins > Media player > Manage media players" to check which players are enabled and their order of preference. The VideoJS player must be placed above all others.
