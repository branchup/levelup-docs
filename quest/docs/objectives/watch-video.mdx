Objective to require the recruit to watch one or more videos to completion.

## Setting up

Setting up the objective does not require any setting other than the number of videos to be watched.

## Behaviour

The algorithm for detecting that a video was watched to completion balances rigidity and leniency to provide the best user experience while achieving the intended behaviour. As such, jumping to the end of the video will not be considered valid. Conversely, watching 100% from start to finish is not strictly required.

Watching the same video multiple times will not progress the objective multiple times.

## Eligible videos

The videos compatible with this objective must be inserted in Moodle directly using Moodle's built-in text editor. Those must be played by the built-in video player called "VideoJS", which is the default behaviour. Videos that are played using another mechanism or player are currently not supported.

Any video within the context of the mission can contribute to the objective.
