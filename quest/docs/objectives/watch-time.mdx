title: "Spend time watching videos"
---

Objective to require the recruit to spend a certain amount of time watching videos.

## Setting up

The only setting to provide is the amount of a time a recruit must spend watching videos.

## Behaviour

The algorithm will observe the number of seconds being watched and count them at regular intervals. The elapsed time is measured according to the video's timer, which means that watching a 2-minute video at twice the speed will count as 2 minutes, even if only 1 real minute was spent watching. Watching the same content multiple times will count multiple times.

## Elligible videos

The videos compatible with this objective must be inserted in Moodle directly using Moodle's built-in text editor. Those must be played by the built-in video player called "VideoJS", which is the default behaviour. Videos that are played using another mechanism or player are currently not supported.

Any video within the context of the mission can contribute to the objective.
