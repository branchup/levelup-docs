title: "Complete profile"
---

This objective require recruits to complete their profile information.

### Setting up

During the setup, it is required to choose which profile fields recruits must complete. These can be regular or [custom](https://docs.moodle.org/en/User_profile_fields) profile fields.

Note that some fields cannot be selected:

- Required fields
- Hidden custom fields
- Locked custom fields

### Completion criteria

Recruits need to visit their profile and fill in the missing information to complete the objective. Just visiting the profile or changing other fields will not count.

If a recruit's profile is already filled out, their objective will automatically be marked as completed.
