# Adding the block

The plugin is a Moodle block that can be added to the front page, the dashboard and in courses. It is via the block that learners will interact with the quests, achievements and challenges. Instructors will also access Quest pages via the block itself.

:::info

By default, the permission to view the block is given to all users.

:::

## Adding the block anywhere

1. Go to the page where you want to add the block to.
2. Turn editing on.
3. Click the "Add a block" button.
4. Choose "Level Up Quest" from the list.

:::info

To make the block _sticky_ so that it displays on more pages than the page where it was added, please refer to [official Moodle documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Block_settings#.27Sticky_blocks.27).

## Adding the block to everyone's dashboard

Follow these few steps to make the block available to all users on their dashboard.

1. Go to the page "Site administration > Appearance > Default Dashboard page".
2. Turn block editing on.
3. Click the "Add a block" button.
4. Choose "Level Up XP" from the list.
5. Move the block to its preferred location.
6. Click the button "Reset Dashboard for all users".

:::caution

A common mistake users make is to add the block to their own dashboard, and then wonder why it is not visible to other users. The dashboard is a personal page, and thus blocks must be configured via the "Default Dashboard page".
