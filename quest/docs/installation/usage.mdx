# How to add Quest to the site

The plugin is a Moodle block that can be used sitewide (front page, dashboard) and in courses simulteneously. It is via the block that learners will interact with the quests, achievements and challenges. Instructors will also access Quest pages via the block itself.

To use the plugin, you must first make it accesible by adding the block to the page.

:::info

By default, the permission to view the block is given to all users.

:::

## Adding to a course

1. Go to the course that you want to add Quest to.
2. Turn editing on.
3. Click the "Add a block" button.
4. Choose "Level Up Quest" from the list.

:::info

To make the block _sticky_ so that it displays on more pages than strictly the page where it has been added, please refer to [official Moodle documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Block_settings#.27Sticky_blocks.27).

## Adding to everyone's dashboard

Follow these few steps to make the block available to all users on their dashboard.

1. Go to the page "Site administration > Appearance > Default Dashboard page".
2. Turn block editing on.
3. Click the "Add a block" button.
4. Choose "Level Up Quest" from the list.
5. Move the block to its preferred location.
6. Click the button "Reset Dashboard for all users".

:::caution

A common mistake users make is to add the block to their own dashboard, and then wonder why it is not visible to other users. The dashboard is a personal page, and thus blocks must be configured via the "Default Dashboard page".
