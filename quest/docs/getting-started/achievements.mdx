# Achievements

Achievements are a playful way to recognise and celebrate learners once they reach specific goals. They act as an enticing engagement tool for completionists by revealing each available achievement, but keeping the commemorative visual hidden until the objective is met. This approach builds anticipation and motivates learners to persist until they unlock both the surprise image and a celebratory moment.

Each achievement displays:

- A memorable, eye-catching name
- Playful, clear, or even intentionally obscure instructions
- Real-time progress tracking
- A hidden visual reward, revealed upon completion
- A brief celebration, emphasising the learner's success

For best results, make achievement names over the top and consider intentionally keeping instructions cryptic to add extra excitement. This playful twist amplifies engagement, boosts motivation, and gives learners an even bigger reason to celebrate their accomplishments.

## When to Use?

We believe there are three main ways to use achievements:

1. To welcome and encourage a learner starting their journey.
2. To congratulate and acknowledge a learner's effort.
3. To encourage deep completion and perseverance.

### To Welcome & Encourage

By setting up simple achievements that can be earned early in a learner's journey, you create a delightful surprise and an immediate sense of enthusiasm. It also introduces achievements as a fun element that can be unlocked along the way.

**Examples**
- **Just landed!** Instructions: We're just getting started! (Objective: Access the course for the first time)
- **New beginnings.** Instructions: Complete your first activity.
- **Couch potato.** Instructions: Watch your first video.

### To Congratulate & Acknowledge Effort

These achievements mark important milestones or track repeated actions, highlighting a learner's steady progress. They provide positive reinforcement and keep learners motivated.

**Examples**
- **Halfway there!** Instructions: Reach a 50% completion rate.
- **Printing press.** Instructions: Contribute 50 forum posts.
- **Just... one... more... episode...** Instructions: Watch 10 hours of videos.

### To Encourage Completion & Perseverance

These achievements demand more dedication, perfect for learners who enjoy a challenge. They spur participants to complete optional tasks, remain consistent, and engage with the course regularly.

**Examples**
- **Hello neighbour!** Instructions: Access the course 7 days in a row.
- **No stone left unturned.** Instructions: Complete all activities.
- **Ascended!** Instructions: Reach the maximum level.
