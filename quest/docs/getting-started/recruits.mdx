title: Recruits
---

Recruits are users who have been assigned a mission. Users will not know anything about a mission until they become a recruit. For instance, a quest that is discoverable cannot be seen or interacted with by users who have not been recruited.

Delaying the recruitment of a mission is an important feature as it allows for progressive engagement of the learner without the risk of overwhelming them. It also makes it possible to add unexpected events to the story and change the learner's experience over time.

## How to recruit users?

Beyond the obvious option to recruit users manually, there are two main ways to recruit users for a mission.

### Recruitment automations

Recruitment automations automatically assign the mission to the users matching the automation settings. There are several types of automations that can be used for a variety of use cases. Achievements, challenges and the very first quest will use automations such as "Course members" as they are expected to broadly assigned.

However, as quests **create a storyline**, they should only be assigned when the narrative evolves. There are two options to create begin a Quest after another one.

- Using the **"Recruit for a quest" outcome** in first quest will start the second one when the first one is finished.
- Using the **"Quest progression" recruitment automation** in the second quest, targetting the first quest.

The "Quest progression" and "Challenge success" automations can be used to assign challenges when a quest starts, or to assign a quest when a challenge is failed. That can create interesting narrative possibilities!

### Outcome: Recruit for â€¦

There are several outcomes allowing to recruit a learner for another mission when they end one. The outcome "Recruit for a quest" will therefore recruit the user for a new quest (or multiple ones) once they have completed a previous one. We refer to this method as chaining quests together.

In the same way, learners can be recruited for an achievement or a challenge. This ability to recruit learners at different times allows instructors to progressively disclose other missions, or to give challenges when it fits a narrative for example.

## Search & filtering

Several screens of the Level Up Quest management pages include lists of recruits with a "Filter recruits" search field. The terms in the search field are evaluated against multiple user identity fields, allowing instructors to quickly find the most relevant recruits.

Identity fields include first and last names, and possibly the email address, ID number and username if the instructor has the permission to access this information. The visibility of these fields is defined by the administrator.

Quest will not broadly look for any field _containing_ the search term. For instance, typing "am" to find a user named Amanda Holden **will not** return recruits named "J**am**ie" or those with an @ex**am**ple.com email address.

Quest smartly applies the search term to the first and last name. As such, if we are looking for Amanda Holden, we can search for "am", "ho", "amanda h", "a h", or even "ho am" to find recruits **partially by first name, last name, and initials, in any order**.

Partial matches on username, ID number and email address require at least 3 characters. To search by email domain, include the @ symbol in the search term (e.g. @example.com).
