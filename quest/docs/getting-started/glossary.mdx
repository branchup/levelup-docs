# Glossary

Please note the terms that we are being used throughout the documentation.

### Mission

 A broad term that covers any format providing objectives to a learner. Missions can take the form of quests, achievements, challenges, or streaks. We'll use "mission" to refer to any of these without listing them individually.

### Quests

A creative approach that uses a storyline and a character to give learners structure and objectives. Completing a quest can result in rewards or trigger side effects.

### Achievements

Celebrations of learners reaching certain milestones. Learners can see the entire list of achievements and their requirements, encouraging them to collect them all.

### Challenges

Objectives that can have a time limit and may repeat. Learners (recruits) can earn rewards by completing these challenges.

### Streaks

Indicators of how many consecutive days (or weeks) learners meet their objectives. Missing one day breaks the streak, which encourages consistent participation.

### Lifecycle of a Mission

The different stages a mission goes through: assigned, started, completed, and ended. Each stage changes how a learner (recruit) interacts with the mission.

### Mission tracker

A place where learners can find all of the missions that are relevant to them at a particular point in time.

### Recruit

Refers to any learner or user who has been assigned a mission. We use this term to avoid assumptions about enrolment and to indicate anyone taking part in a mission.

### Rewards

Anything provided to the learner upon completing their mission. While the idea of a reward can vary, in this context itâ€™s something the learner is expected to value.

### Side Effects

Logic triggered at the end of a mission that is not directly tied to the mission itself, such as automatically enrolling a learner into a group upon mission completion.

### Outcomes

The collective term for rewards and side effects. These outcomes are triggered when a mission ends and include any defined rewards or side effects.
