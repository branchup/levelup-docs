# Glossary

Please note the terms that we are being used throughout the documentation.

A **mission** is a generic term that encompasses any mechanism giving objectives to a learner. Missions take the form of **quests**, **achievements** and **challenges**. The documentation will use the term **mission** to refer to the three of those without needing to mention them individually.

A **quest** is a type of mission that contains a storyline, a couple of objectives and optionally some outcomes.

An **achievement** is a type of mission that contains a single objective.

A **challenge** is a type of mission that contains a couple of objectives, some outcomes, that is typically limited in time, and can be set to be reccuring.

The **lifecycle** of a mission refers to the different stages that a mission can be in. A mission is firstly **assigned**, then **started**, then **completed** and finally **ended**. Each of these represent a different stage which influences the relationship between a recruit and their mission.

**Recruit** refers to learners, or any user, that has been assigned to a mission. Essentially, any person partaking in a mission will be considered to be have been recruited for that mission. Using the term recruit allows us to freely refer to a learner or user without making the assumption that they have been recruited for a mission. Similarly, in Moodle, learners only become _learners_ when they are enrolled in a course.

**Rewards** is anything offered, shared, or sent to the learner as they complete their mission. The concept of reward is subjective and both the instructor and learner may view those differently, but in the context of the documentation we refer to something that the learner is meant to view as a reward.

**Side effects** typically refer to logic that is triggered at the end of a mission that is not directly associated with the mission itself. For instance, automatically adding a learner to a group after they completed a mission is considered to be a side effect.

**Outcomes** is the generic term used to refer to **rewards** and **side effects**. In other words, the _outcomes_ of a mission are triggered when the mission ends, and they take the form of the rewards and side effects defined by the instructor.
