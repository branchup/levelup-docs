# User information and privacy

The information collected by the Moodle plugin Level Up Quest is contained within the Moodle installation and is **never** transmitted, communicated or shared with us or third parties. All internal mechanisms are executed and stored within Moodle itself.

In some cases, Quest can enable instructors to send direct messages, including emails, to participants. The availability of these features is controlled by the permissions given to instructors in Moodle.

Level Up Quest conforms to Moodle's requirements for privacy and GDPR compliance.
