# One-time payment or subscription?

**In short, it is a one-time payment, with optional yearly renewal.**

When you purchase the plugin, you may use it forever, it will keep working even when the licence has expired. The licence grants you access to the latest version of the plugin, so when it expires you are left behind. Other benefits such as email support also require an active licence.

There are numerous reasons why you may want to keep your licence active, one of which is to benefit from bug fixes and compatibility with upcoming Moodle versions. We do not recommend to upgrade a system while using outdated plugins.

We do not enforce the renewals so you can decide what to do when we email you that your licence is about to expire.
