# Number of websites limitation

Licences allow you to use the plugin with a certain number of websites. A website is defined by the URL at which end-users access the plugin.

Whether the URL is a subdomain, a domain, or a sub directory, each point of entry to your Moodle site qualifies as one website. This applies regardless of whether the source code is shared between several sites. In technical terms, each `$CFG->wwwroot` qualifies as 1 website.

Note that development, staging and testing environments do not count towards the limit, provided that they are solely used for development and testing purposes and that end-users never access those.

The URLs at which the plugin will be used must be nominated upon purchase, and you must inform us if those change.

If you intend to make the plugin available to a large number of websites, please contact us to discuss.
