# Number of websites limitation

Licence packages allow the use of XP on a certain number of websites. A website is defined by the URL at which users access the LMS.

Whether the URL is a subdomain, a domain, or a subdirectory, each point of entry to your Moodle site qualifies as one website. This applies regardless of whether the source code is shared between several sites. In technical terms, each `$CFG->wwwroot` qualifies as one website.

Certain licence packages allow for the deployment on development, staging and testing environments without counting as a website. Those environments are expected to be solely used for development and testing purposes and must not be accessed by end-users.

The URLs at which the plugin will be used must be nominated upon purchase, and you must inform us if those change.

If you intend to make the plugin available to a large number of websites, please contact us to discuss.
