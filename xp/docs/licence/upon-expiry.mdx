# What happens when my licence expires?

When your licence expires, the plugin will keep working in its current state and environment.

However you will lose access to newer versions of the plugin. With an access to the latest version:

- You can obtain a version compatible with newer Moodle versions
- You benefit from new features and improvements
- You benefit from bug and security fixes
- You benefit from our email support

It is important to keep plugins up-to-date. As a general rule of thumb, we do not recommend that you upgrade your Moodle site while using outdated plugins.

Renewing your license directly impacts our ability to fund the maintenance and development of both XP and XP+. We do not renew licences automatically, we will email you when your licence approaches its expiry.
