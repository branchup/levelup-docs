# What happens when my licence expires?

When your licence expires, the plugin will keep working in its current state and environment.

However you will lose the following benefits:

- Access to the latest version
- Compatibility with newer Moodle versions
- New features and improvements
- Bug and security fixes
- Email support
- Peace of mind

It is important to keep plugins up-to-date. We do not recommend upgrading a Moodle site while using outdated plugins.

Renewing your licence directly impacts our ability to fund the maintenance and development of both XP and XP+. We will contact you when the licence expiry approaches.
