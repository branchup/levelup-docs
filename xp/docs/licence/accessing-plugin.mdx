# How do I access the plugin?

After a successful purchase, you will receive an email containing a link to download your copy of the plugin. The plugin can then be [installed](/getting-started/installation/plus.mdx) on your site like any other plugin.

The download link will remain valid and will always point to the latest version of the plugin you have access to. If you lose it, you can recover it using our [licence recovery tool](https://levelup.plus/recover).

If you do not receive the purchase confirmation email within the hour, please check your spam and promotions folders. If you cannot find the email, please contact us.
