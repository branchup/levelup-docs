# Reset learners' points

At times, it is handy to reset the points collected by learners. This can be achieved in a few different ways.

## Whole course, or group reset

On the report page, you will find the option to reset all data in the page menu. If the course is using groups, you can first switch to a given group to only reset the data of group of learners.

## Reset individual learners

From the report page you have the ability to delete a single user. This will not only delete their points, but also delete their logs. Deleting the logs will enable learners to potentially re-earn points from previous actions.

:::note

This feature was added in XP 3.7. At the time it did not delete a learner's logs, and thus they could not re-earn points from certain previous actions. Since XP 3.13, the logs are deleted as well.

## Course reset

_Level Up XP_ is not compatible with the [course reset](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Reset_course) functionality built-in Moodle due to a limitation of the latter.
