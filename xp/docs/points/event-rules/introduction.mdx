# Event rules

XP observes the actions performed by learners and attributes them points. By default, XP comes with a few pre-defined rules to determine how many points a learner should earn.

In Moodle, such actions are referred to as _Events_. Events contain information about the action that was just performed: where it happened, what it was, who did it, etc. It also contains the _educational level_ of the action, either _participating_, _teaching_ or _other_.

As a starting point, XP attributes points to learners for the actions of educational level _participating_, when they _create_, _edit_ or _read_ course contents. For example, they would receive _45_ points when creating a new forum discussion, and receive _9_ points when reading course resources.

These default rules are simple but educators can do a lot more. They can create much more granular rules, such as giving more or less points for a specific activity, or giving more value to submitting one assignment over another, etc.

## Actions that are ignored

Only the users with the [capability](/getting-started/permissions.mdx) _block/xp:earnxp_ can earn points. By default, this capability is given to the student role. Also, actions triggered by guests, non-logged in users or administrators are ignored.

The following events are always ignored:

- Events from another _context_ than course or module
- Events having another educational level than _participating_
- Events flagged as _anonymous_, e.g. in an anonymous Feedback

The default rules of XP ignore some events that are redundant, and would cause points to be awarded twice for the same action.

Repeated actions within a short time interval are also ignored to prevent cheating when the [cheat guard](./cheat-guard/index.mdx) is enabled.

:::info

Since XP 3.15, administrators can be allowed to earn points by enabling the `adminscanearnxp` admin setting.
