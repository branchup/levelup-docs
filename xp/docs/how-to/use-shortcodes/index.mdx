# Use shortcodes

import RequiresXpPlus from '@site/src/components/RequiresXpPlus';

:::info

To use shortcodes with Level Up XP, the plugin [Shortcodes](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_shortcodes) must be installed and enabled.

:::

## Introduction

Shortcodes are short words delimited by square brackets such as `[xpbadge]` which can be added to text editors in Moodle. When displayed, they are transformed into alternate content. The term shortcode was popularised by Wordpress.

Here are the shortcodes built-in _Level Up XP_:

- [xpbadge](#xpbadge): To display the level badge
- [xpdrop](#xpdrop)^: To award points anywhere
- [xpiflevel](#xpiflevel): To display or hide some content according to the students' level
- [xpladder](#xpladder): To display the leaderboard
- [xpteamladder](#xpteamladder)^: To display the team leaderboard
- [xplevelname](#xplevelname): To display the level name
- [xppoints](#xppoints): To highlight points displayed as experience points
- [xpprogressbar](#xpprogressbar): To display the progress bar

^ Requires _Level Up XP+_

### xpbadge

Displays the badge matching the level of current user.

`[xpbadge]`

### xpdrop

With this shortcode, points can be awarded virtually anywhere. However, it is not intended to be constructed manually. Please see the [documentation page to use drops](/points/drops/index.mdx).

### xpiflevel

Displays the content within its brackets according to the user's level. When a level is strictly specified, the content will be displayed regardless of the other rules. The greater and less than rules must all match for the content to be displayed, watch out as that may sometimes result in the content never being displayed! Note that teachers, or other users with editing capabilities, will always see everything.

```
[xpiflevel 1 3 5]
    Displayed if the user's level is exactly 1, 3 or 5.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel >3]
    Displayed if the user's level is greater than 3.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel >=3]
    Displayed if the user's level is greater or equal to 3.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel >=10 <20 30]
    Displayed if the user's level is greater or equal to 10 AND is strictly less than 20
    OR is exactly equal to 30.
[/xpiflevel]

[xpiflevel <=10 >=20]
    Never displayed because the user's level can never be less or equal to 10 AND more or equal to 20.
[/xpiflevel]
```

Note that these shortcodes CANNOT be nested within one another.

### xpladder

:::info

From XP 19, the shortcode will include the `ctx` and `secret` parameters when copied from the leaderboard page.

:::

By default, a portion of the ladder surrounding the current user will be displayed.

```
[xpladder]
```

To display the top 10 students instead of the neighbours of the current user, set the parameter `top`. You can optionally set the number of users to display like so `top=20`.

```
[xpladder top]
[xpladder top=15]
```

A link to the full ladder will automatically be displayed below the table, if you do not want to display such link, add the argument `hidelink`.

```
[xpladder hidelink]
```

By default, the table does not include the progress column which displays the progress bar. If such column has been selected in the additional colums in the ladder's settings, you can use the argument `withprogress` to display it.

```
[xpladder withprogress]
```

Note that when a course is using groups, the ladder will best guess which group to display the ladder of.

### xpteamladder

<RequiresXpPlus />

:::info

From XP 19, the shortcode will include the `ctx` and `secret` parameters when copied from the leaderboard page.

:::

By default, a portion of the team ladder surrounding the current user will be displayed.

```
[xpteamladder]
```

To display the top 5 teams instead of the teams neighbouring those of the current user, set the parameter `top`. You can optionally set the number of teams to display by giving `top` a value, like so: `top=20`.

```
[xpteamladder top]
[xpteamladder top=15]
```

A link to the full ladder will automatically be displayed below the table if there are more results to be displayed, if you do not want to display such link, add the argument `hidelink`.

```
[xpteamladder hidelink]
```

By default, the table does not include the progress column which displays the progress bar. If such column has been selected in the additional colums in the ladder\'s settings, you can use the argument `withprogress` to display it.

```
[xpteamladder withprogress]
```

Note that when the current user belongs to multiple teams, the plugin will use the one with the best rank as reference.

### xplevelname

By default the tag displays the name of the current user's level.
Alternatively, you can use the `level` argument to display the name of a specific level.

```
[xplevelname]
[xplevelname level=5]
```

If the `level` argument is provided and the level does not exist, nothing will be displayed.

### xppoints

Displays, and highlights, a number of points formatted as experience points.

```
[xppoints 1000]
[xppoints]
[xppoints plain]
```

If the number of points is not specified, it will display the number of points held by the current user. The `plain` keyword will display the number of points without any formatting.

:::note

This shortcode was added in XP 3.12.0. The ability to display the current user's points and the `plain` keyword were added in XP 3.15.0.

:::

### xpprogressbar

Displays the current user's progress bar towards the next level.

```
[xpprogressbar]
```
