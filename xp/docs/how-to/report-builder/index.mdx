# Custom reports

import RequiresXpPlus from '@site/src/components/RequiresXpPlus';

Administrators can make reports using Moodle's Custom Reports (Report Builder). They control who can see the reports and can set them to be emailed regularly. XP's support for custom reports means that the points of any user can be reported on in any course. It is also possible to aggregate the results and combine the points of several courses into a single report.

## Create a report

1. Navigate to "Site administration > Reports > Custom reports".
2. Click "New report".
3. Select the "Level Up XP+: XP Participants" report source.
4. Select the option "Include default setup".
5. And click "Save".

## Give access to users

1. Edit the report.
2. Choose the "Audience" tab.
3. Assign users to the report.
4. Close the report.

The selected users will have access to the report from "Site administration > Reports > Custom reports". If that page is not visible to them, the direct link to the report can be shared with them.

## Send periodically

1. Edit the report
2. Choose the "Schedules" tab.
3. Create a new schedule.
4. Set the "Recurrence" to "Weekly", or "Monthly".
4. Select the audience to send the report to.
5. Save and close the report.

The report will be sent to the audience as per the schedule.
