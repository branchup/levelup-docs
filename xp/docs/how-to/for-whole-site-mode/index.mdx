# Use one block for all courses

By default, _Level Up XP_ keeps a different record of a learners points for each course. In order to gather experience points from all the courses a student is participating in, the admin setting _Where are experience points used?_ must be set to 'For the whole site'.

This setting is located under _Site administration > Plugins > Blocks > Level Up XP > General settings_. Once set, any block newly or previously added will start displaying the experience points earned in any course.
