# Level in navigation bar

:::info

This feature was added in XP 3.15.

:::

Displaying the level globally in the navigation is easy, but must be done by the site administrator. Navigate to Administration > Plugins > Blocks > Level Up XP > General settings, and enable the setting `navbardisplay`.

This setting is heavily dependent on the theme you are using, and may not work as expected with 3rd party themes. We recommend to turn it on to see if it works and to confirm that it does not break the theme.

If it does not appear, or the level does not display properly, please contact your theme designer.

  In Boost, the level is displayed in the navbar next to the user's profile.
