# Permissions

By default, the permissions grant teachers and managers the rights to add the block and configure it, and grant students the ability to earn points and view the block and their level.

## block/xp:earnxp {#earnxp}

:::note

Given to the **Student** role by default.

:::

Probably one of the most powerful capability, this controls whether a user can earn points for the actions they perform in the given context. Typically, non-students should not be given this permission in order to avoid for them to earn points and appear in the leaderboard.

Using this capability you may restrict entire sections of your course, or site from contributing to a user's experience points. For example, you may set this permission as _Prohibited_ for the _Student_ role for an entire category, subsequently any event occurring in a course or activity within this category will be ignored. You may do the same for a single course or even a single activity.

## block/xp:view {#view}

:::note

Given to the **Authenticated user** role by default.

:::

This permission determines whether the block will be visible to a user. When prohibited, a user will not see the block, and won't be able to access any of its pages.

## block/xp:manage {#manage}

:::note

Given to the **Teacher**, **Manager** roles by default.

:::

Users with this permission can manage all aspects a plugin's instance. They will be allowed to change any setting, the levels, the rules, the appearance, etc. This permission also allows to edit, import, and reset learners' points.
