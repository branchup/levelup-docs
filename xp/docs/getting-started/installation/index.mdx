You may choose to install the plugin using git. However, please note that the `master` should not be used. The `master` branch is reserved for development, can contain unstable code, and is certainly not recommended in production.

We recommend to checkout the latest tag.

```
cd blocks/xp
git tag -l | sort -Vr | head -1
git checkout <tag here>
```
