# Displaying the XP block

When the plugin is used [per course](../per-course-or-site.mdx), the block must be individually added to each course. However, when the plugin is used [globally](../per-course-or-site.mdx), all instances of the block will use the exact same configuration.

:::info

By default, the permission to view the block is given to all users.

:::

## Adding the block anywhere

1. Go to the page where you want to add the block to.
2. Turn editing on.
3. Click the "Add a block" button.
4. Choose "Level Up XP" from the list.

:::info

To make the block _sticky_ so that it displays on more pages than the page where it was added, please refer to [official Moodle documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Block_settings#.27Sticky_blocks.27).

## Adding the block to everyone's dashboard

Follow these few steps to make the block available to all users on their dashboard.

1. Go to the page "Site administration > Appearance > Default Dashboard page".
2. Turn block editing on.
3. Click the "Add a block" button.
4. Choose "Level Up XP" from the list.
5. Move the block to its preferred location.
6. Click the button "Reset Dashboard for all users".

:::warning

A common mistake users make is to add the block to their own dashboard, and then wonder why it is not visible to other users. The dashboard is a personal page, and thus blocks must be configured via the "Default Dashboard page".

## Troubleshooting

If the "Level Up XP" option is not listed in the "Add a block" list, please confirm that:

- You have the [permission](../../getting-started/permissions.mdx) to add the block (block/xp:addinstance).
- On the frontpage and dashboard, that XP is used in [sidewide mode](../../getting-started/per-course-or-site.mdx).
- The block was not [locked by an administrator](https://docs.moodle.org/404/en/Managing_blocks).
