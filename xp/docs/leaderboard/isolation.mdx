# Isolate leaderboard participants

All users who have collected points are visible in the leaderboards. With the following options, groups of individuals can be isolated from one another by simulating multiple independent leaderboards.

- [Default (group mode)](#default): The default option, using course groups.
- [Using cohorts](#cohorts): Isolation using cohorts.

## Default (group mode) {#default}

This mode is applied by default in all versions of Level Up XP. In this mode, XP observes the [group mode](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Groups#Group_modes) setting of a course to determines whether to isolate participants. The group mode is a Moodle feature that defines isolation of participants at the course level using course groups.

The group modes "Visible groups" and "Separate groups" will isolate participants based on their group memberships in the exact same fashion as Moodle isolates those participants.

:::info

This option does not apply when XP is used sitewide as the "group mode" course setting is not available globally.

## Using cohorts {#cohorts}

import RequiresXpPlus from '@site/src/components/RequiresXpPlus';

<RequiresXpPlus plan="Premium" />

With this option, participants are isolated from each other based on their cohort membership. Only members of the same cohort will appear in a person's leaderboard.

:::info

Participants should belong to only one cohort. If they belong to multiple cohorts, their leaderboard will be randomly chosen from one of those cohorts.
