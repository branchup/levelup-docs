# The block cannot be deleted

XP follows the same rules as any other Moodle block when it comes to editing and deletion; however, there is one situation where the block may not be deletable. That is, if the block was added to the dashboard, or frontpage, while the plugin was set in "Sitewide" mode, then switched back to "Per course". Then, the delete option will not appear.

You must remove those block instances first.

## Deleting orphan sitewide blocks

:::note

This applies when the plugin is used "Per course", but blocks had been added in "Sitewide" mode.

:::

1. Navigate to _Site administration > Plugins > Blocks > Level Up XP > General settings_
2. Switch the plugin to [sitewide mode](../../getting-started/per-course-or-site.mdx)
3. Navigate and delete the previously undeletable blocks
4. Navigate back to _Level Up XP's_ settings and revert back to "Per course" mode
