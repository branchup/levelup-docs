# The plugins are out of sync

What does it mean when _The plugins are out of sync_?

When you have installed Level Up XP+, and later on upgraded Level Up XP, the plugins fall out of sync. This means that Level Up XP+ is now extending a version of Level Up XP that it was not developed against.

:::warning

We strongly advise against upgrading a plugin without its counterpart to ensure the integrity and proper functioning of the plugins.

:::

:::warning

When a version of XP+ becomes excessively older than that of XP, XP+ may automatically disable itself to prevent malfunctioning.
