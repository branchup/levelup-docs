# The plugins are out of sync

What does it mean when _The plugins are out of sync_?

When you have installed _Level Up XP+_, and later on upgraded _Level Up XP_, the plugins fall out of sync. This means that _Level Up XP+_ is now extending a version of _Level Up XP_ that is was not developed against.

During development we do our best to anticipate compatibilty issues that could arise from this, however we cannot always guarantee it.

For example, there has been instances where some added features to _Level Up XP (free)_ were hidden if an older version of _Level Up XP+_ was installed. As a result users had to upgrade _Level Up XP+_ for the additional features to become available.

To ensure the integrity and the well functioning of the plugins, we recommend that you do not upgrade a plugin without its counter part.
