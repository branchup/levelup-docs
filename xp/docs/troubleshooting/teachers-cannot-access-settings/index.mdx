# Teachers cannot access reports and settings

By default, XP gives access to restricted pages (settings, reports, logs, ...) to the teacher role, however when the plugin is used sitewide this permission is only granted to managers.

To remedy this, a role allowing the permission(s) must be given to the relevant users at the site level.

If XP is used per course, you should double check that your typical teacher roles have been granted the permission.

## Which permission to give?

There are more than one permissions to consider, please consult the [permissions page](/getting-started/permissions.mdx) to determine which better suit your needs.
