# XP+ disabled

If you see a notice that Level Up XP+ has been disabled, it means none of its features are active. Level Up XP will function as if the add-on was not installed. If you make use any XP+ features, you will likely want to fix the problem as soon as possible.

## When does this happen?

This happens when Level Up XP (block_xp) is upgraded to a new major version that is newer than the installed version of Level Up XP+ (local_xp). To reduce the risk of administrators upgrading XP without also upgrading XP+, a warning message is shown before any Moodle upgrade. If the administrator upgrades anyway, XP+ is automatically disabled to prevent problems with the Moodle site.

## How to fix this

### Method 1: Upgrade XP+ (recommended)

The easiest way is to upgrade Level Up XP+ (local_xp) to a version with the same major version number as Level Up XP (block_xp). For example, if you installed Level Up XP 18.0, you must install Level Up XP+ version 18. To get the latest version of XP+, visit your licence download link. If you lost the link, you can [recover it here](https://www.levelup.plus/recover).

### Method 2: Downgrade XP (discouraged)

If you cannot upgrade XP+, you can downgrade Level Up XP (block_xp) to a version that works with your installed XP+ version. Be careful, this might cause other problems. We strongly recommend making backups before you start. Ask your Moodle administrator to do the downgrade, as this needs to be done manually and requires good knowledge of Moodle.

### Method 3: Ignore incompatibility (discouraged)

If you cannot use the methods above, you can choose to force XP+ to activate even though it is not compatible. This is not safe. It might not work, even if it seems to work at first. This method makes XP+ work with a version of XP it was not made for. This can cause problems from loss of functionality to fatal errors.

To ignore the incompatibility, add `$CFG->local_xp_accept_incompatibility_with = XPVERSION;` to your `config.php` file. Change `XPVERSION` to the exact Level Up XP version found in `blocks/xp/version.php`. After clearing the cache, XP+ will no longer be deactivated.
