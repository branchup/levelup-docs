We dropped the `v3.` prefix of XP and the `v1.` prefix of XP+. XP `v18` is the version following `v3.17` and XP+ `v18` is the version following `v1.17`. From this release, XP and its compatible XP+ version will have the same number.

<h3>New features ✨</h3>

- Admins can automatically pre-populate the leaderboards with XP participants
- Leaderboards can be configured to allow users to opt-out (XP+ Premium)
- Administrators can enforce that all leaderboards support opt-out (XP+ Premium)

<h3>Quality of life 💪</h3>

- Improved the column sizes of the report table
- Improved accessibility of the levels management page
- Improved accessibility of rule to match activities by name
- Admins are warned before an upgrade if XP+ will be disabled
- Admins will receive an notification if XP+ becomes disabled

<h3>Bug fixes 🐛</h3>
