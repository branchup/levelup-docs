<h3>New features âœ¨</h3>

- The team leaderboard made of groups supports groupings

When set to use the _course groups_, the team leaderboard will automatically filter out the groups that are not part of the course's [default grouping](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Groupings). This is useful when courses contain a large number of groups.
